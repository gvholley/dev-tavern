Dev-Tavern helps game developers connect with each other and recruit contributors to projects. Users can create their projects and list what kind of developer they are looking for. Users can join other people's projects, and are notified via their profile whether or not they were accepted into a project. Projects can be found with keywords via the search engine, or through tags. Dev-Tavern was created in one week with the same team as FaciLita. http://dev-tavern.herokuapp.com/
